# Socket.io: Controllable and Synced Counter

The counter is updated in real time and can be controlled from anywhere in the world!

Live demo: https://socketio-synced-counter.herokuapp.com/

**Note:** This is not a full fledged application! Instead it is made for a live-quizzing platform I'm currently working on. But anyways, it's quite intuitive to understand and a good example to get a grasp of [socket.io](https://socket.io).

***Happy Learning! :)***
